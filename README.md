# Modules.ScriptBlockLoggingAnalyzer
When scriptblock logging is enabled, all source code is logged and can be examined. 
This module contains a few functions that help enable, manage, and disable scriptblock logging for Windows PowerShell.
It especially makes it easier to retrieve the source codes for logged scriptblocks by combining the multi-part eventlog entries.
